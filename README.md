# Boonacrity

For now, this is an empty project (heavy WIP).
This mod plans on adding a PVP/Utility-esque magic system via DBD-inspired totems & different spell categories. While that's the main mod's gimmick, a lot of other stuff is planned…



# Magic classes
-# Note : This section is still a heavy WIP. Many things (if not everything) will change in the future ; Don't take everything said below as actual information ! Also, a proper in-game guide will be proposed for getting the hang of everything.

### Boons

Boons are your primary form of magic — hence the name. They are mostly used for giving it's caster a load of different benefits & buffs, mostly utilitary ones. They are recognized via light blue-yellowish flames.

### Hexes

Hexes are mostly used to debuff enemies & grant the caster offensive benefits & buffs. They are usually casted with a higher resource cost than boons, and their totems are more fragile in general. Some hex totems may require an extra activator (sourced via a target) to curse them until a totem is destroyed ; When a target destroy a totem they're cursed with, they are temporarily immune to hexes (unless said otherwise). They are recognized via black flames.

### Charred hexes

Charred hexes are automatically created when active totems conflict with eachother or a cast backfires. They usually give the caster a huge hinderance & are impossible to clean without special tools/spells.
